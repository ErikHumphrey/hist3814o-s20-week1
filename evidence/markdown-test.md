# Markdown test

## Headings

# This is an H1 heading.

(Generally, I would probably only use one of them, but this document has two. As you can tell, using two may have wrecked the flow of the document by having a second H1 heading so soon after the opening one.)

## This is an H2 heading.

### This is an H3 Heading.

#### This is an H4 heading.

##### This is an H5 heading. 

###### This is an H6 heading.

####### This would be an H7 heading, but it turns out most Markdown interpreters or browsers [only support H1 to H6](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp). But in theory, [one could create any element one wants to](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22638917/3011319).

This sentence has *these words* in italics.

## Paragraphs

When separating paragraphs...

I make two line breaks between paragraphs. But if I wanted to make a line break without creating a new paragraph, I would put two spaces at the end of a line, followed by a single line break.
